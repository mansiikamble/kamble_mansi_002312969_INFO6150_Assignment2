    More About My project.<br>
    <p>Topic : Zigbee – GSM based automatic meter reading system (2020-2021)<br><p>
        Description: 
        1.Reducing manpower and resources used for meter reading are a common objective in utility and
        energy management projects. It involved monitoring and managing electrical consumption using
        various technologies and hardware components like Zigbee, Arduino, wi-fi and gsm modules. 
        2.Applied programming skills like c++ and python alongside the knowledge of JavaScript to develop 
        software component which provided real time data of the system. The system's flexibility allows for
        the addition of more parameters, making it adaptable to evolving needs and expanding its functionality.</p>
